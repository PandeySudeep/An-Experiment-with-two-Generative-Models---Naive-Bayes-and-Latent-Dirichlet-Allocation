# An Experiment with two Generative Models: Naive Bayes and Latent Dirichlet Allocation

## Overview
In this experiment I put together four categories of news articles - 'soccer', 'Americal footbal', 'cricket' and 'basketball'. With Naive Bayes, I wrote a classifier that when applied to test data sets (10 articles for each classes), generates following result:
