The teams were tied at 89 with 4:38 left, then exchanged leads until a steal by Burke led to a dunk by Mudiay, who was fouled by Garrett Temple. The resulting free throw gave the Knicks a 97-93 lead.

Kanter’s play in the third quarter helped the Knicks overcome a double-digit deficit.

Memphis built the lead to 13 in the third quarter, but New York rattled off a 15-2 rally to tie it at 68l when JaMycal Green was called for goaltending when he pulled down the net on Kanter’s put back.

Meanwhile, Memphis was having no luck at all shooting, connecting on 6 of 20 shots in the third.

That led to a 78-71 lead for New York after the third.

Memphis led 52-43 lead at the half based on Memphis holding the Knicks to 34 percent shooting in the first half, including 4 of 15 from outside the arc. Part of the New York shooting woes came from eight blocks by the Grizzlies.

Memphis would finish with 19 blocks for the game.
