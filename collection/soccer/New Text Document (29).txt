AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — The 11-member Oceania Football Confederation says it is backing FIFA President Gianni Infantino for re-election.

The Oceania group says its executive committee — comprising 11 member federation presidents in New Zealand and the Pacific islands — voted unanimously to support the FIFA leader.

Infantino is seeking a full four-year term from 211 FIFA member countries at a June 5 vote in Paris. He was elected in February 2016 to complete the mandate of Sepp Blatter, who was banned by FIFA’s ethics committee.

Infantino has no challenger yet before a Feb. 5 deadline for potential candidates.
