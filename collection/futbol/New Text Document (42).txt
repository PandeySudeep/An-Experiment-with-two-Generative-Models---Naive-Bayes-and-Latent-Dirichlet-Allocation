FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady did not participate in the team’s last practice before Sunday’s game against the New York Jets and was listed as questionable to play.

The 41-year-old three-time NFL MVP hurt his knee when he slipped after receiving a pass in last week’s game against Tennessee. He was listed on the injury report as limited for Wednesday’s workout; the team did not practice on Thanksgiving Day.

Since taking over as the starter when Drew Bledsoe was injured in the second game of the 2001 season, only once has Brady missed games for injury, when he tore apart his knee in the 2008 opener and missed the rest of the season.

He also missed the first four games of the 2016 season to serve a suspension for his role in the team’s illegal football deflation scheme.

“When there’s a player like that (who is not) in … you’ve just got to be more alert and more aware and just got to make sure you’re on top of your job and your assignment and everything,” tight end Rob Gronkowski said.

“Because, no lie, he knows the playbook inside and out, basically every position, so if he’s not in there, you’ve just got to make sure you know what you’re doing, your knowledge and do your job.”

Gronkowski, who missed three of the last four games with ankle and back injuries, and running back Sony Michel were also listed as questionable on the injury report.

“I’m not worried at all. Just feel good and I’m excited for the game Sunday,” said Gronkowski, who would not elaborate on his injury. “I don’t even know what it was. I just had to fix it.”
