ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Washington left tackle Trent Williams was taken to a hospital for precautionary reasons after getting hit in the chest but just missing one play in the Redskins’ loss to the Dallas Cowboys.

Williams stayed on the ground along the sideline at the end of an 8-yard run by Kapri Bibbs in the third quarter of the Cowboys’ 31-23 victory Thursday.

The 30-year-old Williams missed the next play, a 10-yard touchdown pass from Colt McCoy to Trey Quinn, but returned for the next Washington series after a two-minute scoring drive by Dallas.
