      "Chelsea superstar Eden Hazard, who is having one of the best seasons of his career with the Premier League club, has hinted at a possible departure from the club in the near future. Hazard spoke out about his contract situation on Sunday prior to Chelsea's Europa League clash against PAOK on Thursday -- which can be streamed on fuboTV (Try for free) -- and had some interesting things to say about his future, while also willingly admitting he could stay with the Blues for the rest of his career. Here's what to know:\n",
      "\n",
      "What did Hazard say?\n",
      "In an interview with Canal Football Club, the 27-year-old said he is unlikely to leave in January but, \"it's possible [that I could leave in the summer], as I repeat every time, but it's also possible I stay at Chelsea for my whole career.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the moment, as I have already said, I'm focusing on Chelsea this year. I have a year on my contract after this year. If there is no contract extension, of course [I could be sold].\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That sure sounds like Hazard hinting at possibly wanting a contract extension. Since his contract expires in the summer of 2019, it's unlikely he would begin next season with the Blues if he was out of contract the following summer. The club would risk losing him for nothing, and surely the club's leadership knows selling him would bring in a price of well over $100 million, though the preference has to be to keep him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It remains to be seen if his next contract will make him the highest paid player on the roster over N'Golo Kante. If he is offered a bigger contract and doesn't accept, then the writing may be on the wall that he wants to leave Stamford Bridge. \n",
      "\n",
      "If he does accept a deal, then that will end any speculation he is leaving, at least for a little while. \n",
      "\n",
      "Where could he go?\n",
      "In looking at the clubs that could afford him, there are probably only a handful. While clubs in England like Manchester United and Manchester City could pay the fee, it's hard to see Chelsea being willing to sell him to one of them. On top of that, Hazard had the choice to join any of the three from Lille back in 2012. \n",
      "\n",
      "So while you can't rule out going to either Manchester club, it feels unlikely. That leaves only a handful of teams that have the roster space and the pocket change to invest in a player like Hazard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Paris Saint-Germain\n",
      "\n",
      "He's familiar with the league having played for Lille, and this is a club that has made more of a splash in the transfer market than anyone over the last couple seasons. Financial Fair Play is always a cloud hanging over a big-spending team like PSG, but landing a whale like Hazard makes sense for a ton of reasons. Can you imagine if Edinson Cavani had Neymar, Hazard and Mbappe playing behind him? It would be hard to imagine any team getting in the way of that fearsome foursome and would solidify this team as the heavy favorite to win the Champions League. But doing so would likely require PSG to sell off some important players to balance the books. \n",
      "\n",
      "Real Madrid\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of a contract extension with Chelsea, this seems like the most probable destination. Real Madrid is struggling, and it just recently fired Julen Lopetegui and lost to Eibar this past weekend. He could follow his former teammate Thibaut Courtois and head to the Spanish capital, and he would be looked at as the star replacement in attack following Cristiano Ronaldo's departure to Juventus. The coaching instability of the club and the aging stars like Luke Modric and Sergio Ramos would give anyone second thoughts. He could be viewed as the man for the team and a new \"Galactico,\" and we all know Real Madrid has the money to make that work, especially after getting over $100 million for Ronaldo. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bayern Munich\n",
      "\n",
      "This feels like kind of the dark horse team. Bayern isn't playing that well and is in fifth place in the Bundesliga. They having aging wingers in Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, so it could be time to make a change. The funds are there for sure, and there is so much talent on the team that he could be a natural fit right behind or to the side of Robert Lewandowski. This one feels unlikely but a bit more possible than say Barcelona or Juventus. But it's hard to see this one happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "What do the oddsmakers say?\n",
      "Betfair has odds on who he will sign with before Feb. 1, 2019. And the options are to stay at Chelsea or to sign for Real Madrid, with staying at Chelsea being the favorite.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Staying at Chelsea is 1/50\n",
      "Signing for Real Madrid is 9/1\n",
      "When could we hear something?\n",
      "Considering Kante just signed a contract extension with the club, it wouldn't be out of the question to hear something on this in the coming months, and if not, in the summer. But by the time summer rolls around, we could be hearing about an extension or a possible transfer if it takes that long.\n",

But he defied the ban and was in RiverÕs dressing room in Porto Alegre. The Brazilian club wanted sanctions against River but CONMEBOL only extended GalllardoÕs ban to the two final matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "RiverÕs local rival, Racing, also complained about the illegal inclusion of midfielder Bruno Zuculini in their round-of-16 match. CONMEBOL said the complaint arrived too late.\n",

      "CONMEBOL also annulled a decision made on the pitch. Brazilian defender Dede of Cruzeiro was shockingly sent off in the first leg of the quarterfinal against Boca after an accidental collision witht goalkeeper Esteban Andrada. Dede was allowed to play in the second leg.\n",

      "It looks like one of America's top young soccer players is set to make the move to the Premier League. CBS Sports can confirm The Athletic's report that the Columbus Crew and MLS are finalizing a deal to send goalkeeper Zack Steffen to Manchester City.\n",

      "Now, it is too early to tell how this move will play out. Steffen, 23, has a lot of talent, but one has to wonder how much time he will see at City in the coming years. A loan move makes a lot of sense for a season or two. City -- which faces Lyon on Tuesday in Champions League action on fuboTV -- currently has 25-year-old Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson on the roster, and he's viewed as one of the top goalkeepers in the league and a potential superstar at the position. \n",

He's been a big part of the team's quality run of form over the last couple seasons, but his contract is set to expire next summer, so there's a chance he could possibly move at some point and open up the starting spot for Steffen. \n",

      "Bengals-Browns is a usual meeting, but Bengals-Browns featuring former Cleveland head coach Hue Jackson now serving on the Cincinnati staff is rare.

      "Mayfield, still new to the league but not to the business of both pro and college football (considering his transfer experience), has a valid point. But Jackson isn't the first to make such a move; the Bengals were founded by a man who'd been shown the door by the Browns before retreating to the banks of the Ohio River to plot his revenge (his name was Paul Brown). For Mayfield and his teammates, it's more about the fact Jackson went almost immediately from Cleveland to the team's AFC North rival in Cincinnati, in the same season.\n",

I want to make that play. But we're inside our own 10. Long yardage situation. They had been playing soft coverage, sinking everyone underneath. In those long-yardage situations, the percentages are low. We're thinking if we can get a block on one guy and make one guy miss there were a couple of situations where we were able to get close on those runs. But as a competitor, it's tough.

      "The Houston Texans (8-3) kept their distance from the AFC South pack on Monday evening, running through the Tennessee Titans (5-6) en route to a 34-17 victory, Houston's eighth consecutive win. Here's what we learned:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What a bizarre career for Lamar Miller. The eighth-year running back became the first player in NFL history with two rushes of at least 97 yards when he took a second-quarter handoff from the shadow of his end zone to the opposite end of NRG Field. Miller was quiet after that game-changing toke, finishing with 162 yards on 12 carries for 13.5 yards per carry. After a slow start to the season, Miller has averaged over four yards per carry and tallied over 100 scrimmage yards in four of his last five games. Miller spearheaded a Texans rushing attack that racked up 281 yards on Tennessee's top-10 rushing defense and helped extend Houston's six scoring drives. Missing from Houston's game plan for the past year-and-a-half has been a consistent ground game. With five games left in the season, the Texans are paving holes for their running game and a path toward an AFC South title.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Another fateful goal-line decision from Mike Vrabel set Tennessee back early. Down four early in the second quarter, the Titans were facing a fourth-and-1 on Houston's three-yard line. Tennessee could have run Marcus Mariota on a read or a sweep or a dive into the line; Mariota was perfect in his career on one-yard conversion rushing attempts. But the Titans instead called a fullback dive to a blocking tight end in Luke Stocker. Houston read it from a mile, er, yard away and stuffed the stocky tight end. On the very next play, Miller burned Tennessee for a 97-yard TD run. A 10- to 14-point swing in two plays. The decision to go for it on fourth in the red zone reminded me of the end of Tennessee's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in London when the rookie head coach attempted a two-point conversion to win when an extra point would have extended the game. Sometimes fortune doesn't favor the bold, especially when your play calls are unfortunate.\n",

But things are much different now. James led the Cavs to a title, he didn't make a TV special out of his decision to leave, and given how bad the Cavs are this season, his decision looks like a wise one.

There will be so many emotions swirling around the building, given the state of the franchise and all of the adversity ahead. Showing LeBron some well-deserved love at this stage of the process might be a bit more than the masses can handle. LeBron knows that. He remembers 2010 and what kind of reception he got in his first game back in Cleveland in the opposing team's uniform.

      "\n",
      "Here in Dubai, with Pakistan needing to lift their game by several notches to level the series, he quickly understood the need to play a key role in giving his side a big lead. At the end of the third day, he had just completed his third ten-wicket haul in Tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Astonishingly, he barely needed two sessions to get there. On either side of lunch on Monday, his spells of dazzling unplayability scythed through New Zealand in little over an hour; 83 balls separating the fall of Jeet Raval's wicket, the first of the innings, to Trent Boult, the last. Yasir finished with 8 for 41, not to mention a run-out he played a major, if fortuitous, role in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I came [here] in the morning, I was thinking that I had to take 10 wickets in the match,\" Yasir said. \"I didn't know that I would end up taking 10 wickets in a day. Now, I will try to help the team get those eight [second-innings] wickets as quickly as we can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other two came in the second innings with New Zealand following on. Raval was deceived in flight to be stumped, while Kane Williamson, the one batsman who had stood up to Pakistan in the first innings, received a pearler, a vicious side-spinner extracting a thin outside edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I had a plan for each batsman, because every batsman has got their own weakness and strengths,\" he said. \"Against Australia, I was getting my rhythm back slowly because I was just coming back from injury. You need time to get your rhythm after an injury. Today, I bowled really well. I had worked hard in training. I think that's one of the reasons. I bowled well in the last Test as well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He conceded being the lead spinner in spin-friendly conditions added to the pressure on him. \"Sometimes you do feel the pressure here. because spinners get more wickets. So everyone expects you to take wickets. So you need to work even harder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He would not be drawn into discussions about whether he was among the best spin bowlers in the world currently. He insisted he was merely concentrating on improving his game to help his side win matches. Even so, the statistics make for some very flattering reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Yasir made his debut, only two spinners, R Ashwin and Nathan Lyon, have taken more wickets than his 191. But they have both played significantly more matches than his 32, with Ashwin laying claim to 229 wickets from 43 matches, and Lyon 206 from 47. It is exalted company to keep, but Yasir isn't allowing himself to get carried away.\n",
      "\n",

      "Trevor Bayliss has warned that it is too soon to say whether Rory Burns and Keaton Jennings can be considered England's answers to their long-term problem at the top of the Test batting order, in spite of the key contributions they made to a memorable 3-0 series whitewash against Sri Lanka.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking in the aftermath of England's 42-run win on the final day in Colombo, Bayliss admitted that the Test team remains far from the finished article, in spite of what he described as a \"great result\" in achieving the team's first overseas clean sweep since 1963.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, despite praising his players for the manner in which they bought into the positive strategy that, as a former Sri Lanka coach, he felt was required for success on their spin-dominant pitches, he insisted that \"statistics will tell the story\" as to whether Jennings and Burns can forge long-term futures in the side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the two, Jennings produced the most memorable performances, compiling a match-defining century in the first Test at Galle while excelling himself under the helmet at short leg with a succession of world-class interventions in all three games. However, he also came into the series under the greater scrutiny, having averaged just 18.11 in five Tests against India last summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burns, meanwhile, made a key pair of contributions to the second Test at Kandy, including a maiden Test half-century in the second innings in which he shelved his natural game to give England a brisk start in overturning a first-innings deficit. But he still finished the series with a middling return of 155 runs at 25.83 in the three matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I probably don't think so,\" Bayliss told Sky Sports when asked if the pair had done enough to cement their places in the longer term. \"Obviously statistics will tell a story there, they are still both fairly young in the Test game, and have shown some good character in the way they've gone about it. It's been exceptional at times, but in the end, for every one of the 11, runs and wickets count.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the subject of England's overall strategy - one which clearly paid dividends in the course of the series - Bayliss admitted that there had been times, not least in the first innings at Galle, when they had veered on the side of reckless, but reiterated his belief that positivity and aggression were the way to go in conditions he knew well from his four-year stint with the Sri Lanka team from 2007 to 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the past, teams have come here and decided to bunker down, wait for the bad ball and bat for a long time,\" Bayliss said. \"But quite simply, with the spin over here, eventually there's going to be a ball with your name on it, so we decided to take the attack to them. Don't let them dictate to us, we wanted to dictate to them. We thought it was the way to go, and certainly panned out that way in the first two games.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We said after that first day in Galle [when England went to lunch on 113 for 5], that first session we were a bit frenetic. There's a fine line between being busy and looking to score, being mentally positive, and going over the top and trying to hit good balls for runs. You still have to defend well and hit the bad ball for four. With that mental approach, if you are in the right frame of mind, your feet move well and you make good decisions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bayliss did, however, concede that the demands of England's fast-paced strategy had put particular pressure on Jennings, Burns and Ben Foakes, the eventual Man of the Series, but a player who - by his own admission at Galle - is more comfortable with grinding his runs than blazing them in the manner of his more expansive batting colleagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Foakes, Jennings and Burns are three guys who probably haven't got as many shots as the other boys,\" said Bayliss. \"But they went about their game in a positive manner as well, they were able to rotate the strike and put pressure on the opposition by playing their game, and when they got a bad ball, they put it away for four.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of his own success, Foakes in particular will be under pressure going into the West Indies tour, and ultimately the 2019 Ashes, from his rival for the wicketkeeper's role, Jonny Bairstow, who made it clear after his comeback century at Galle that he would not be satisfied at playing as a specialist batsman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked if that burgeoning rivalry was one to keep an eye on, Bayliss said: \"The short answer is yes, we don't want to put any undue pressure on other people. But it does keep the guys in the team on their toes and, in the long run for England, that's a good thing when you've got competition for places and depth to select from. Even Jos Buttler wants to keep, but the way Foakesy has gone in this series, he'll definitely be in for the next one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since I've been here, every time there's been a challenge thrown to Jonny, he's been able to come out and score some runs,\" Bayliss added. \"The trick for us is to try to come up with a challenge for him every time he comes out to bat. He's got the goods, and the challenge for him will be at home on seaming wickets, but he's got the talent to master that as well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In keeping with his reserved judgment on England's overall series performance, Bayliss also mixed praise for his captain, Joe Root, with mild criticism of his personal contribution of 229 runs at 38.16, as he challenged the side to get better and better in all departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's probably disappointed with the amount of runs he's scored, even though he's scored a great hundred up in Kandy,\" said Bayliss. \" I think more so from a captaincy point of view, he's really been in charge, you can tell in the changing room he's in charge, and some of his decisions out in the field have been pretty good. I still feel there's a lot of improvement in these guys yet, which is an exciting thing for England cricket.\"\n",
      "*******\n",
      "Ben Stokes turned matches, and Sri Lanka's batting lacks maturity, but even with all that, and despite the 3-0 result, there wasn't much separating the teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are Sri Lanka coach Chandika Hathurusingha's views after Sri Lanka were whitewashed at home by England. While in the first Test in Galle, Sri Lanka were blown away by 211 runs, the hosts had their moments in Pallekele and at the SSC. They lost the second Test by 57; the third by 42.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought it was a very closely fought series especially the last two games,\" Hathurusingha said. \"The difference between the two teams was very little. I thought England handled tough situations well. Ben Stokes was the difference in the last two games, I thought. \"Other than the first Test, I thought we fought hard in the second and third games. A few issues we have to sort out, no doubt. While batting, we took some wrong options and that is the reason why we lost. Had certain things gone our way, the result could have been different.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stokes hit 187 runs at an average of 31.16 in the series, but it was his contributions in the field and with the ball that Hathurusingha made particular mention of. At Pallekele, he effected a crucial direct-hit run out of Dimuth Karunaratne - Sri Lanka's best batsman of the series - to cut short what had been a promising second-wicket stand in the first innings. Then at the SSC, he delivered a furious 10-over spell of hostile bowling either side of tea on the second day, as Sri Lanka lost nine wickets for 67 runs, in what turned out to be the definitive passage of play.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When things were going our way, Stokes was brilliant with the ball and on the field,\" Hathurusingha said. \"He took the game away from us in both games. When we were 173 for one in the first innings here, again England took the initiative away from us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In what was otherwise a dispiriting series, perhaps the only bright spark for Sri Lanka and Hathurusingha was the spin attack, which had to contend with the departure of Rangana Herath following the first Test. England never made 350, though they probably would have at Galle, where they declared on 322 for 6 in the second innings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Herath's like-for-like replacement Malinda Pushpakumara took nine wickets in the series, but it was the younger spinners who made the more impactful contributions. In Pallekele, offspinner Akila Dananjaya, who is presently awaiting the results of his biomechanics test after being called for throwing, took 6 for 115 in the second innings. At the SSC, left-arm wristspinner Lakshan Sandakan claimed 5 for 95 in the first innings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those efforts were not enough to cover for batting failures, however. Four Sri Lanka batsmen made it into the eighties in the series, but no further. England, meanwhile, had four centurions in Ben Foakes, Keaton Jennings, Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought in these last two games, given our inexperienced attack due to the absence of Rangana we competed well,\" Hathurusingha said. \"The big difference is four hundred they scored and no hundreds from us. The toss has got lot to do as well when you are playing on these types of wickets. Of course we should have used the DRS better on hindsight. But all in all, England played better.\"\n",
      "*******\n",
      "England have shown they can no longer be considered \"a one-trick pony\" who can only win at home, according to their captain, Joe Root.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they have long had a strong reputation at home, where their seamers are often able to exploit helpful conditions and a Duke's ball, England's results away from home have been far less impressive. Going into this tour, they had not won any of their last 13 away Tests and were without an away series victory since early 2016 in South Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, by completing a 3-0 series win in Sri Lanka, England have managed a first-ever whitewash in Asia (in series of three matches or more) and first away from home anywhere since 1963.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, underlining the changing face of this side, they have done it without their leading Test run-scorer, Alastair Cook, who retired at the end of the English summer, and with their two senior bowlers, Stuart Broad and James Anderson, contributing just one wicket between them. Instead their trio of spinners claimed 48 wickets (49 if Root's one victim is included), while the batsmen took a much bolder approach to the turning ball than is typical for England sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Root feels the captaincy growing on him\n",
      "Joe Root feels his confidence and his authority as captain have increased as a result of England's success in Sri Lanka.\n",
      "\"I felt I was growing into the role very nicely towards the end of the India series,\" Root said. \"We've done things very differently here and I've had to drive that and made a point of it.\n",
      "\"People might have thought 'that's a bit radical' but it's really worked for us and that's a great lesson for this group moving forward and for me as captain. It has filled me with a huge amount of confidence.\n",
      "\"Everyone has really accepted it and bought into it and now we have seen it work. Hopefully this can be the start of this team really growing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That, Root believes, shows the adaptability of his new-look side. And it is a quality he has urged his players to continue to embrace as they look ahead to 2019, in which tours of the Caribbean, New Zealand and South Africa sandwich a home Ashes campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've had to do things very differently here,\" Root said. \"It's been amazing how much the ball has turned. So the most pleasing thing is how quickly we adapted to that. We've had to adapt and grow as a group.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've been brave. We've done things differently to how we have in the past, but that's not frightened us. We really bought into that and played it to our advantage. We've got three wonderful spinners that complement each other very well, backed up very ably by some very good seam bowling\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's nice to know we don't just rely on Anderson and Broad. We gave opportunities for young, less experienced guys to step up and show their worth. Those three spinners dovetailed really well and built pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look at Rory Burns, as an example. He's been a consistent performer at the top of the order for Surrey, but has spent most of his time facing seam bowling with the ball zipping around. Here, on his first trip with England and all the pressures that brings, he has faced spinners with a new ball, which is completely different to anything he will have experienced before. But he has been brilliant and played a vital role. That's one example of how we've adapted and grown as a group.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we've got to be open to doing things differently wherever we go. We've done things in a certain way in these conditions. But it will be different in the West Indies, different in South Africa and obviously very different in Australia next time we're over there. That's the one we really want to get right. But we've got some time to figure out what's going to work for us and adapt our squad to exploit those conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's about being adaptable and we've shown we can do that. We've shown we are not a one-trick pony any more. And that should fill us with a huge amount of confidence going into future tours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While Root, who is getting married at the weekend, was particularly pleased that the victory had been a good squad effort, he did pick out a few of his players for praise. Moeen Ali, who finished with 18 wickets, was one, with Ben Foakes, who was named player of the series, another. But his most effusive praise was reserved for Ben Stokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Moeen has really stepped up as a senior bowler and led the way,\" Root said. \"He's been quite vocal at times on plans and trying to get the best out of the other two guys and he deserved a lot of credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Foakes has been brilliant, too. He has come into the team on very difficult surfaces, stood up to the stumps for long periods of time and looked pretty faultless. It's great to see him take to Test cricket as well as he has.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we all know that, at any stage, Ben Stokes can turn a game on his own. There were a couple of moments of brilliance in the field in Kandy and then here he found a way as a seam bowler to expose batters on this surface. That's a great skill. With bat and ball, he's adapted to different roles, whether that's been looking for reverse swing, trying to bowl short, or batting up and down the order.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He always gives absolutely everything and he'll never shy away from any challenge put in front of him. He's a complete team man and sets a brilliant example to the rest of the group. He is a great leader within that dressing room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But while Root stressed he was proud of his team, he was unapologetic about leaving senior players such as Broad and Jonny Bairstow out of the side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look at any side that's No.1 in the world,\" Root said. \"They' always got some very good players missing out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's where we want to be. We want to keep pushing, keep improving and get to that No.1 status.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we're really serious about that, guys are going to have to work very hard and accept that on occasions they're going to miss out. Having that environment is going to keep driving the guys in the team forwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It feels like we're in a good place at the moment, we can't be happy with where we are. We've got to keep looking to improve. We've a lot of hard work to do, but it's great to see us grow at a team on this trip.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "That's probably understandable, too. Leach is a sound fielder but his direct hit from deep backward square leg - every bit of 50 metres from the stumps at the non-striker's end - was sensational.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leach initially seemed just a little slow to reach the ball played towards him by Roshen Silva. But, alert to the situation and heeding his team-mates' calls to throw to the other end, Leach threw with admirable power and left Mendis well short with a direct hit.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an inspired piece of fielding, for sure, and drew comparison with Ben Stokes' run-out of Dimuth Karunaratne in Pallakele and the excellent work Keaton Jennings has been doing at short leg as key moments that have made the difference between the teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an important moment, too. Mendis, who had made 86, appeared to be batting Sri Lanka back into contention in the third Test, adding 102 for the fifth-wicket with Roshen. England were starting to look just a little flat and just a little nervous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would love to say I've been working on those long-distance throws but I'd be lying,\" Leach admitted. \"I've never done anything like that and actually think it was the best moment of my career so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My towel at the back of my trousers wasn't quite in properly so, just before the ball came to me, I quickly threw it to the boundary. And then suddenly it looked like they were going to run two and I thought 'oh no! I've conceded two here and I shouldn't have done that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So, I just launched it towards the stumps and thought 'that's going to hit' and luckily it did. So I was a bit lucky, really. It was a big moment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Leach admitted he was close to exhaustion by the end of the game. The burden of bowling more overs than any other England bowler in the series, in back-to-back Tests and brutally hot conditions, was starting to take its toll, so he confessed his primary emotion upon taking the final wicket was simply relief that he could return to the air-conditioned dressing room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm absolutely knackered,\" he said. \"I thought it was hot during the first two Tests, but then I got to Colombo and was like 'maybe it wasn't that hot [before].' Because it turns out Colombo is proper sweaty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sri Lanka pushed us all the way. After the tea break Joe Root threw me the ball and I had to get the body going again. So I was just happy to get that wicket and get off the pitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has tested me physically, definitely. None of the guys are used to this so it is even more special that we could put in good performances to get the win.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the moment I just don't want to play cricket ever again, I'm so tired. But I'll give it a couple of weeks and then I'll be keen to get back in the gym and work on some things that I feel I can get better at and get myself ready for the Caribbean if I'm picked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He needn't worry about selection. His is certain to be in the tour party and has a decent chance of winning selection even if England play only two spinners in some games in the Caribbean. And, even though he stresses that \"everyone contributed\" to the team's success, he does accept he has had \"a great trip\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a huge thrill to come out here and take wickets on spinning tracks,\" he said. \"There have been ups and downs, but to come out on top with a 3-0 result is amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has been a great trip for me. I feel like I've learnt a lot through winning games, which is how you want it. But I also think I need to keep getting better so this tour will really help me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everyone has contributed: Stokesy's run-out in Kandy and his spell of bowling here; Keaton's fielding at short leg. Little things have made a big difference. And the way the batters have played has been something special. Rooty asked us to be brave with the bat and we've done that. It's special result. I'm just glad to have been able to play my part and be involved.\"\n",

      "Somerset have confirmed the return of Pakistan batsman Azhar Ali as overseas player for the whole of the 2019 season. Azhar, 33, will be available to play a full part in the Specsavers Championship and the Royal London Cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Azhar is currently Pakistan's leading active Test run-scorer, but he retired earlier this month from playing ODIs. With the 2019 summer dominated in part by the World Cup in England, and Pakistan only playing white-ball cricket between January and October, Azhar can throw himself into a full campaign at Taunton.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are delighted to have secured a player of Azhar's quality and experience for the duration of the summer and having him available for all our Specsavers County Championship and Royal London One-Day Cup fixtures fits our needs perfectly,\" Somerset's director of cricket, Andy Hurry, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Azhar fitted in seamlessly during his time with us towards the back end of the 2018 season. Knowing the positive impact that he will have both on and off the field, alongside his availability all summer were key factors in wanting to secure him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whilst he was here, he spent a lot of time working alongside the Second XI players and giving them the benefit of his experience. That is exactly the sort of support you want from your overseas signing and I can't speak highly enough of him as a person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Azhar, a former captain of the one-day team, helped Pakistan lift the 2017 Champions Trophy in England. He has been a mainstay of the Test side since 2010, averaging close to 45 with 14 hundreds, and is currently involved in the ongoing series against New Zealand in the UAE. Pakistan then tour South Africa, playing three Tests, but Azhar then won't be called upon until a trip to Sri Lanka later in 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a seven-match stint with Somerset in the Championship last season, he scored 402 runs at an average of 33.50, with a best score of 125.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I very much enjoyed my time with the club this year and I am really pleased to be going back,\" Azhar said. \"Somerset is a special club and it was a pleasure to play for them in 2018. There was a really good atmosphere in the dressing room and there are some very good players at the club. The supporters were excellent, and I look forward to seeing everyone again next year.\"\n",

      "Diana Edulji, the former India women captain who is part of the two-member Committee of Administrators (CoA), has said the CoA will not interfere in the controversy surrounding Mithali Raj's omission from India's side for their Women's World T20 semi-final against England last week. Raj, India's senior-most player and their highest run-getter in the T20 format, was left out despite being passed fit - she had missed India's last group match against Australia with a knee injury - and scoring fifties in her last two innings. India went on to lose the semi-final by eight wickets after collapsing from 89 for 2 to 112 all out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edulji said the CoA, appointed to supervise the BCCI by India's Supreme Court, could not burden itself with cricketing decisions. However, she added that the CoA would address the concerns of any players if they were to approach the panel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier on Monday, Raj, India captain Harmanpreet Kaur and team manager Trupti Bhattacharya had separate meetings with Rahul Johri, the BCCI chief executive officer, and Saba Karim, the BCCI's general manager cricket operations. After meeting India coach Ramesh Powar later in the week, Johri and Karim are likely to prepare a report that they will submit to the CoA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision to leave Raj out of the semi-final against England was taken by the team management comprising Harmanpreet, Powar, vice-captain Smriti Mandhana and selector Sudha Shah after they watched the first semi-final between Australia and West Indies. They agreed to stick with the same combination that had beaten Australia convincingly, which meant the allrounder Anuja Patil kept her place in the XI ahead of Raj. Bhattacharjya convened the meeting of the think-tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harmanpreet said the decision was a collective one taken in the interests of the team, but it came in for strong criticism from the media and former players. The CoA is understood to have asked for Raj's fitness logs over the weekend, but Edulji has now said it was not appropriate for the committee to interfere in cricketing matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The CoA will not get involved in the issue,\" Edulji said. \"We will not go into cricket issues. Who plays in the XI is not our headache. And it should not be anybody's headache. It is a decision to be taken by the team management.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mithali Raj takes a few throwdowns during Railways' warm-up session ESPNcricinfo/Annesha Ghosh\n",
      "Edulji said it wasn't the business of the CoA to question the team management's decisions. \"Because see what are the conditions, what is the wicket playing like, what is the dew factor, what is the strength of the opposition - all that how can CoA, sitting in India, decide the playing XI whether it is right or wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edulji also rubbished speculation in India's women's cricketing circles that she was taking Harmanpreet's side in the issue, and pointed to the role she had played in bringing both Raj and Harmanpreet to the Railways team in their formative years. She said she had also been instrumental in Raj taking over the Railways captaincy, which paved her way towards becoming India captain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I definitely like Harman's game. I like the way she plays,\" Edulji said. \"Because I was a hitter myself I like people who can clear the boundaries. She changed the complexion of women's cricket after that knock in England (in the World Cup semi-final against Australia). Otherwise there is nothing special that I will go out of my way (to support Harmanpreet). In fact, we hardly talk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Edulji said she was not aware of any differences between Raj and Harmanpreet or between any other players in the team. \"If there are differences off the field, it should not come out on the field,\" she said. \"Once you cross the boundary line, you are playing for the country.\"\n",

      "The Mzansi Super League attracted a live television audience in excess of 3.4 million South African viewers during it's opening weekend that featured four matches. The league is only just starting to gain traction and attract fans to matches as summer sets in, but TV figures suggest the league has already struck up significant interest from viewers watching at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iffy weather, a cold snap on the opening weekend and the introduction of new teams perhaps resulted in the tournament failing to attract huge number of fans to the ground. Only around 7000 fans turned up for the first match between Cape Town Blitz and Tshwane Spartans at the 25,000 capacity Newlands, while 4896 were at Wanderers for the game between Jozi Stars and Nelson Mandela Bay Giants. At the same time, the match attracted 16,65,546 unique TV viewers in South Africa alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "An audience analysis carried out independently by Nielsen Sport revealed that a unique TV audience of 34,18,594 viewed the first four matches in the league. The Saturday night fixture between the Jozi Stars and Nelson Mandela Bay Giants drew the biggest audience, with all four matches going beyond the 1.3 million mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "SABC-3, the channel the games have been broadcast on in South Africa, typically attracts around 21 million South African viewers in a month. The top rated show on the channel is the soap opera Isidingo, which has been running for 20 years and attracts around a million viewers per episode, to which MSL's viewership figures compare favourably.\n",
      "\n",
      "For further comparison, the T20I against Zimbabwe on 12 October attracted 6,07,948 viewers to the channel. Outside of South Africa, a broadcast deal with Sony means that the MSL is also being screened in India on the channels Sony Six and Sony Six HD. CSA also have a deal with UK-based channel FreeSports, which is available in 18 million homes in the UK. FreeSports also aired live coverage of the 2017 Bangladesh Premier League.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This fully justifies our decision to take the SABC on board as our domestic host broadcast partner,\" Cricket South Africa Chief Executive Thabang Moroe said . \"This is truly a product for the people and has helped us achieve one of our key objectives not just to attract traditional cricket fans but to open up a new market as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a win-win situation for all our stakeholders whether they be administrators, players, coaches, fans or our commercial partners. The MSL can only go from strength to strength as it will continue to grow while establishing itself alongside various T20 leagues around the world. The most watched sporting event in South African television history was the opening match between South Africa and Mexico during the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, with a combined 10,146,793 viewers watching the match on SABC 1 and SuperSport 3 on the satellite DSTV network.\n",
      "\n",
      "While figures for match attendances are starting to rise, with the game between Cape Town Blitz and Paarl Rocks last weekend close to sold out, the television viewing figures are an even more positive sign for CSA after their initial attempt at a homegrown league - the defunct T20 Global League - failed.\n",
