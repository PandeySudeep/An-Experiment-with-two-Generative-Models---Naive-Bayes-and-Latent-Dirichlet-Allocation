Somerset have confirmed the return of Pakistan batsman Azhar Ali as overseas player for the whole of the 2019 season. Azhar, 33, will be available to play a full part in the Specsavers Championship and the Royal London Cup.

Azhar is currently Pakistan's leading active Test run-scorer, but he retired earlier this month from playing ODIs. With the 2019 summer dominated in part by the World Cup in England, and Pakistan only playing white-ball cricket between January and October, Azhar can throw himself into a full campaign at Taunton.

"We are delighted to have secured a player of Azhar's quality and experience for the duration of the summer and having him available for all our Specsavers County Championship and Royal London One-Day Cup fixtures fits our needs perfectly," Somerset's director of cricket, Andy Hurry, said.

"Azhar fitted in seamlessly during his time with us towards the back end of the 2018 season. Knowing the positive impact that he will have both on and off the field, alongside his availability all summer were key factors in wanting to secure him.

"Whilst he was here, he spent a lot of time working alongside the Second XI players and giving them the benefit of his experience. That is exactly the sort of support you want from your overseas signing and I can't speak highly enough of him as a person."

Azhar, a former captain of the one-day team, helped Pakistan lift the 2017 Champions Trophy in England. He has been a mainstay of the Test side since 2010, averaging close to 45 with 14 hundreds, and is currently involved in the ongoing series against New Zealand in the UAE. Pakistan then tour South Africa, playing three Tests, but Azhar then won't be called upon until a trip to Sri Lanka later in 2019.

During a seven-match stint with Somerset in the Championship last season, he scored 402 runs at an average of 33.50, with a best score of 125.

"I very much enjoyed my time with the club this year and I am really pleased to be going back," Azhar said. "Somerset is a special club and it was a pleasure to play for them in 2018. There was a really good atmosphere in the dressing room and there are some very good players at the club. The supporters were excellent, and I look forward to seeing everyone again next year."
