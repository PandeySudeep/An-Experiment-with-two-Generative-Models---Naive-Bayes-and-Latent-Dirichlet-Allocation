Sri Lanka will hop over to Scotland for two ODIs before making their trip to England and Wales for the 2019 World Cup, Cricket Scotland has confirmed in a press release. They will compete in two ODIs - on May 18 and May 21 - with the venues slated to be announced in December.

The last time Sri Lanka played Scotland was before the 2017 Champions Trophy for two unofficial ODIs staged in Kent, with Scotland upsetting the visitors in a high-scoring first game. Sri Lanka, though, bounced back to level the series 1-1.

Scotland captain Kyle Coetzer was excited at the announcement of a contest against a Full Member nation, and believed that playing in front of home crowds would only push the hosts to play better cricket.

"There is nothing better that playing cricket at home in front of a full house of Scottish fans and we are determined to continue to improve on our recent performances," Coetzer said. "We will be well prepared for these matches and go out to win.

"We are really excited to be playing these ODIs versus another Full Member. Following our 1-1 draw in the 50-overs series last year, it will be a real challenge for us to go one better and win this ODI series."

The last ODI between the two sides in Scotland was in 2011, when a Lasith Malinga five-wicket haul skittled the hosts out for 101.

The 2019 World Cup begins just nine days after the ODI series, with Sri Lanka's first game scheduled against Afghanistan on June 4 in Cardiff.
