England women will host West Indies next summer as part of their build-up to the Ashes, with the series against Australia once again contested on a points system across all three formats.

Taunton is set to host its first women's Test since 2006, while the Ashes will begin on July 2 at Leicestershire's Grace Road ground, venue for the first two of three ODIs. Canterbury will be the location for the third ODI, while the three T20Is will be held at Chelmsford, Hove and Bristol.

The West Indies visit will feature three ODIs - which will form part of the ICC Women's Championship and go towards qualification for the 2021 World Cup - and three T20Is, starting on June 6 at Grace Road. Worcestershire's New Road ground will host the second ODI, before the series moves to Chelmsford. The teams will then play two T20Is at Northampton, before concluding with a game at Derby.

The Kia Super League, the ECB's domestic women's T20 competition that is set to be replaced by The Hundred from 2020, will take place in August, with Finals Day at Hove confirmed for September 1.

Clare Connor, the ECB director of England women's cricket, said: "As we have just seen in front of record crowds at the ICC Women's World T20 in West Indies, both West Indies and Australia will be sure to provide a great challenge for us as well as skillful, entertaining cricket for the growing fan-base for the women's game.

"Every Ashes summer is a privilege for us all to be part of and we're looking forward to collaborating with all our venues to ensure we deliver high quality match-day experiences throughout the summer of 2019."

England, who finished as beaten finalists at the Women's World T20 for the third time in four editions of the competition, are also due to play series in Sri Lanka and India before the 2019 home season.
