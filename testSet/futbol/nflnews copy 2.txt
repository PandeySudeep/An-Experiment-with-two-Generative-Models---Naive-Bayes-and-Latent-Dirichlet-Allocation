The white-hot Colts will finish their stretch run without the help of Jack Doyle.

Colts coach Frank Reich announced that the veteran tight end is being shipped to season-ending injured reserve after suffering a kidney injury during Sunday's win over the Dolphins.

Doyle's injury required hospitalization, but the team expects the sixth-year pass-catcher to be released soon. The 28-year-old was hurt after taking a big hit in the fourth quarter.

The loss of Doyle leaves Eric Ebron as the team's unquestioned top tight end. That was already true on paper with the free-agent addition ranking second on the roster with 44 catches for 508 yards and 11 touchdowns.

Doyle posted 26 grabs for 245 yards and two scores, but also served as a reliable blocker. His loss puts pressure on a banged-up position group, shifting Mo Alie-Cox -- who missed Sunday's game with a calf injury -- into a more prominent role ahead of Erik Swoope, who also sat out because of a knee injury.
