The Houston Texans (8-3) kept their distance from the AFC South pack on Monday evening, running through the Tennessee Titans (5-6) en route to a 34-17 victory, Houston's eighth consecutive win. Here's what we learned:

1. What a bizarre career for Lamar Miller. The eighth-year running back became the first player in NFL history with two rushes of at least 97 yards when he took a second-quarter handoff from the shadow of his end zone to the opposite end of NRG Field. Miller was quiet after that game-changing toke, finishing with 162 yards on 12 carries for 13.5 yards per carry. After a slow start to the season, Miller has averaged over four yards per carry and tallied over 100 scrimmage yards in four of his last five games. Miller spearheaded a Texans rushing attack that racked up 281 yards on Tennessee's top-10 rushing defense and helped extend Houston's six scoring drives. Missing from Houston's game plan for the past year-and-a-half has been a consistent ground game. With five games left in the season, the Texans are paving holes for their running game and a path toward an AFC South title.

2. Another fateful goal-line decision from Mike Vrabel set Tennessee back early. Down four early in the second quarter, the Titans were facing a fourth-and-1 on Houston's three-yard line. Tennessee could have run Marcus Mariota on a read or a sweep or a dive into the line; Mariota was perfect in his career on one-yard conversion rushing attempts. But the Titans instead called a fullback dive to a blocking tight end in Luke Stocker. Houston read it from a mile, er, yard away and stuffed the stocky tight end. On the very next play, Miller burned Tennessee for a 97-yard TD run. A 10- to 14-point swing in two plays. The decision to go for it on fourth in the red zone reminded me of the end of Tennessee's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in London when the rookie head coach attempted a two-point conversion to win when an extra point would have extended the game. Sometimes fortune doesn't favor the bold, especially when your play calls are unfortunate.
