Leonard Fournette accepted responsibility for his role in a fight that resulted in his ejection from Sunday's 24-21 loss against the Buffalo Bills.

The Jacksonville Jaguars running back wasn't on the field when wide receiver Donte Moncrief caught a 29-yard pass to put the Jaguars at the Bills' 1-yard line in a 14-14 tied ballgame. A skirmish between players on both sides erupted, and that's when Fournette said he left the sidelines to protect teammates.

"Your brothers are getting attacked, they're fighting out there, you're going to have to go there and also protect your own, but at the same time, professional now, I mean, you can't have that," Fournette said. "I apologize to all those kids out there who look up to me and all of our fans. The biggest thing is this whole loss, totally on me. I take full responsibility."

Fournette also issued an apology Sunday on Instagram.
