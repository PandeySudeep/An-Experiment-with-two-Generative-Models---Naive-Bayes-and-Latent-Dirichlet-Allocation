NBA players develop at difference paces, but the window appears to be closing faster on a certain handful of sophomores.

These Top 20 picks from the 2017 draft haven't been able to get comfortable. And though time isn't running out on all of their careers, it's becoming tougher to imagine each of them reaching the potential their teams saw before selecting them where they did. 

Only Top 20 picks were considered, given the low success rates of players taken later.

The Milwaukee Bucks had the chance to add John Collins, Jarrett Allen, OG Anunoby or Kyle Kuzma to their core. Instead, they opted for D.J. Wilson, who'd been quiet through most of three seasons at Michigan before a breakout NCAA tournament drew attention. 

The Bucks ate the bait. Though the idea of Wilson was attractive, being a 6'10" forward with shooting touch, face-up ball skills and intriguing defensive range, he wasn't sharp enough in any one area.

Wilson hasn't come close to cracking Milwaukee's rotation since being drafted, falling even further behind this year after a hamstring injury.

Even with the Bucks picking up his option, it's difficult to picture their 2017 first-round pick making any impact in Milwaukee.
