As a rookie in 1992-93, Shaquille O'Neal proved he belonged in the NBA by winning Rookie of the Year honors, making the All-Star team and dominating in the paint regularly.

Once 1993-94 got started, O'Neal didn't waste time picking up where he left off. On Nov. 20, 1993, Shaquille O’Neal dominated the New Jersey Nets for 24 points, 28 rebounds and 15 blocks in the Orlando Magic's 87-85 win. That game was the only 20-point, 20-rebound, 10-block game in O'Neal's legendary career.

At only 21 years old, this game helped solidify Shaq’s place as one of the most dominant players in the league. That season, O'Neal averaged 29.3 points, 13.2 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game while leading the NBA in field goal percentage (59.9 percent). 

"I guess I played OK," O'Neal said after the game. "It's hard to play from city to city, where it's 40 degrees in one and 80 degrees in the next, but you keep playing. I knew I had about 7 or 8 blocks, but I didn't know I had 15. If we had lost, my performance wouldn't have meant anything."

His 15 blocks were only two shy of the NBA record of 17 set by Elmore Smith of the Los Angeles Lakers against the Portland Trail Blazers on Oct. 28, 1973. 

Overall, O'Neal retired in 2011 with four NBA championships and career averages of 23.7 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game.
